```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the contract

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Run the tests

```bash
npm test
```

## What this Example Covers

1. How to write a smart contract in JavaScript

   a. How to perform cross-contract calls and pass data among them in JavaScript

2. How to write integration tests for a smart contract in JavaScript

## Flows Covered in the Example

1. User A purchases a product in-escrow from User B
2. User A purchases a product in-escrow from User B and cancels the purchase
3. User A purchases a product in-escrow from User B while User B owns no products
4. User A purchases a product in-escrow from User B and approves the purchase
5. User A purchases a product in-escrow from User B and a day passes without approval
6. User A purchases a product in-escrow from User B and attempts to transfer the product to User C


## Detailed Guide in Running the Example

1. Login to your NEAR account

```bash
near login
```

2. Create sub accounts for deploying the contracts

```bash
near create-account --accountId <your-escrow-testnet-account-id> --masterAccount <your-testnet-account-id> --initialBalance <your-escrow-testnet-account-balance>
```

```bash
near create-account --accountId <your-assets-testnet-account-id> --masterAccount <your-testnet-account-id> --initialBalance <your-assets-testnet-account-balance>
```

3. Deploy the Contracts

```bash
near deploy --wasmFile build/escrow.wasm --accountId <your-escrow-testnet-account-id>
```

```bash
near deploy --wasmFile build/assets.wasm --accountId <your-assets-testnet-account-id>
```

4. Initialize the Assets Contract

```bash
near call <your-assets-testnet-account-id> init '{"owner_id": "<your-asset-owner-account-id>", "total_supply": "1000", "escrow_contract_id": "<your-escrow-testnet-account-id>", "asset_price": "100000000000000000000000"}' --accountId <your-assets-testnet-account-id>
```

5. Perform a Purchase on Escrow

```bash
near call <your-escrow-testnet-account-id> purchase_in_escrow '{"seller_account_id": "<your-asset-owner-account-id>", "asset_contract_id ": "<your-assets-testnet-account-id>"}' --accountId <your-buyer-account-id> --amount 0.11 --gas=300000000000000
```

6. Check the Balance of the Buyer Account

```bash
near view <your-assets-testnet-account-id> get_account_assets '{"account_id": "<your-buyer-account-id>"}'
```

```bash
near state <seller-account-id>
```

7. Approve the Purchase

```bash
near call <your-escrow-testnet-account-id> approve_purchase '{}' --accountId <your-buyer-account-id>
```
